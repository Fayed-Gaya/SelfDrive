## Simple talker demo that listens to std_msgs/Strings published 
## to the 'chatter' topic

# rospy is the pure Python client library for ROS. Enables interface with ROS topics, Services, and parameters
import rospy
# Standard ROS messages include comon message types representing primitve data. We are importing strings
from std_msgs.msg import String


def callback(data):
    """
    A callback is a function that is not valled by the dev but defined by the dev.
    A callback functions pointer is passed to another component that calles the function.
    In most cases a callback is a message handler

    :param data: The node that calls the function.
    """

    # get_caller_id() returns the id of the caller
    # What is data.data?
    # loginfo() prints the message to the screen, writes it to the Node's log file, and writes it to rosout.
    # rosout is a tool for debugging
    rospy.loginfo(rospy.get_caller_id() + 'I heard %s', data.data)

def listener():

    # In ROS, nodes are uniquely named. If two nodes with the same
    # name are launched, the previous one is kicked off. The
    # anonymous=True flag means that rospy will choose a unique
    # name for our 'listener' node so that multiple listeners can
    # run simultaneously.
    
    # Initialize the node with the name listener and append a random number to it using the second paramter
    rospy.init_node('listener', anonymous=True)

    # Declares our node subscribes to the chatter topc which is of type String
    # When a new message is received callback is invoked with message as the first argument
    # When a new message is received the callback function is also called as a function pointer to callback() is passed as the third arguement
